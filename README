Congress
========

Congress is my haphazard attempt at a Kademlia-like library for building
P2P overlay networks, which isn't anything original.

Ultimately, however, I don't have the resources to test hundreds of nodes, so
this probably will never work properly.

Requirements
============

* http://github.com/lysol/dogfood
  - Requires jsonlib, Cython

Prereqs on Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install python-dev cython libev-dev distutils
  sudo easy_install pyev jsonlib
  git clone git://github.com/lysol/dogfood.git
  git clone git://github.com/lysol/congress.git
  cd dogfood/
  sudo python setup.py install
  cd ../congress
  sudo python setup.py install

Usage
=====

python -m congress.congress --host 127.0.0.1 --port 16800 --ctl 19800 \
    --peer 1.2.3.4 16800 --debug

Debug will spit out a LOT of information.

Control Port
============
nc or telnet to the port defined in --ctl, at localhost.

Commands
 * listpeers
 * store key val
 * get key
 * peer host port
