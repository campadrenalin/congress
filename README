Congress
========

Congress is my haphazard attempt at a Kademlia-like library for building
P2P overlay networks, which isn't anything original.

K-buckets are not used properly at this time but I'll work on doing that in the
future. Documentation forthcoming.

Ultimately, however, I don't have the resources to test hundreds of nodes, so
this probably will never work properly.
